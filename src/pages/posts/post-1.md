text: "Explicit coercion is code where it is obvious that the intent is to con‐ vert a value from one type to another. The benefit is improvement in readability and maintainability of code by reducing confusion.
Implicit coercion is coercion that is “hidden” as a side effect of some other operation, where it’s not as obvious that the type conversion will occur. While it may seem that implicit coercion is the opposite of explicit and is thus bad (and indeed, many think so!), actually implicit coercion is also about improving the readability of code.
Especially for the implicit type, coercion must be used responsibly and consciously. Know why you’re writing the code you’re writing, and how it works. Strive to write code that others will easily be able to learn from and understand as well."
